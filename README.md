## Fuchsia Learning Resources

[Fuchsia](https://fuchsia.dev/) is an open source effort to create a production-grade operating system that prioritizes security, updatability, and performance.

### Fuchsia Developer Resources

 - [Getting Started with Fuchsia](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/get-started)

 - [Getting started with Zircon Kernel](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/development/kernel/getting_started)

 - [Fuchsia APIs](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/development#api)

 - [Supported Harware for Fuchsia](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/development#hardware)

 - [Supported Programming Languages for Fuchsia](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/development#languages)

 - [Fuchsia Reference](https://fuchsia.dev/reference)

 - [Contributing to Fuchsia](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/CONTRIBUTING)

 - [Google Developers Training](https://developers.google.com/training/)

 - [Google Developers Certification](https://developers.google.com/certification/)

## Fuchsia Tools and Frameworks

[Fuchsia Filesystem Architecture](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts/filesystems/filesystems)

[Fuchsia emulator (FEMU)](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts/emulator) is the default emulator for Fuchsia. FEMU allows you to test Fuchsia components and applications without a physical Fuchsia device.

[Fuchsia Interface Definition Language (FIDL)](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts/fidl/overview) is the language used to describe interprocess communication (IPC) protocols used by programs running on Fuchsia.

[Fuchsia System Interface](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts/system/abi/system) is the binary interface that the Fuchsia operating system presents to software it runs. The foundation of the interface is the vDSO, which provides access to the system calls. Programs are not allowed to issue system calls directly (e.g., by trapping into the kernel). Instead, programs use the vDSO to interface with the kernel. The bulk of the system interface is provided through inter-process communication protocols, typically defined using FIDL. These protocols are spoken over various kernel primitives, including channels and sockets.

[Fuchsia Integrator Development Kit (IDK)](https://fuchsia.dev/docs/development/idk/gn) is a Developer Kit that contains a small set of libraries and tools required to start building and running programs that target Fuchsia.

[Zircon](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts/kernel) is the core platform that powers Fuchsia. Zircon is composed of a kernel (source in /zircon/kernel) as well as a small set of userspace services, drivers, and libraries (source in /zircon/system/) necessary for the system to boot, talk to hardware, load userspace processes and run them, etc. Fuchsia builds a much larger OS on top of this foundation.

[ffx](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/development/tools/ffx/overview) is a tool that provides a unified platform for Fuchsia CLI tools for host target interactions. It introduces a service oriented interface to many common development and integration workflow operations that users may wish to perform against one or more Fuchsia target devices.

[Escher](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts/graphics/escher) is a physically based renderer. It is a C++/Vulkan library that is used primarily by the Scenic implementation; it is not exposed by the Fuchsia SDK.

[Magma](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts/graphics/magma) is the gpu driver architecture for Fuchsia. There are two driver components: a gpu-specific library loaded into each application’s address space; and the magma system driver that manages the hardware.

[Sysmem](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts/graphics/sysmem/sysmem) is a FIDL service that allocates shared memory for use by multiple applications and hardware blocks. This document gives an overview of its major features and what it provides to the system.

[GN](https://gn.googlesource.com/gn/) is a meta-build system that generates build files for [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/). GN is currently used as the build system for Chromium, Fuchsia, and related projects. 

[GN C++ Frontend SDK](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/development/idk/gn) is development kit that currently only supports Linux hosts and the [GN build system](https://gn.googlesource.com/gn/).
